# pacman_project-2018
Project in the ‘Data Structures’ Course of the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering. 
An automated form of the game was implemented, in which the units moved without any user input and according to specific code. 
The code was optimized so that the units made intelligent movements in every step of the game.
